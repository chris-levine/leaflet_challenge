# leaflet-challenge
This is my submission for the leaflet challenge. The goal of this assignment was to create a basic map that displays earthquake data from a GeoJson endpoint. 

Some code that I sourced was from here:
https://leafletjs.com/examples/geojson/

I used this documentation to help with use of the pointToLayer function.
